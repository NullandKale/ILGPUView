MatrixMultiply with CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Allocate2D' does not exist in the namespace 'SharedMemory' (are you missing an assembly reference?) @ : (313,24)-(313,54)
DynamicSharedMemory with CS0234: The type or namespace name 'GetDynamic' does not exist in the namespace 'SharedMemory' (are you missing an assembly reference?) @ : (29,32)-(29,62)

AlgorithmsReduce fails because I dont have cuda blas installed
Mandelbrot fails because it needs forms
